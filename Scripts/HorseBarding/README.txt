Horse Barding

Credit goes to Elkaiozen.

Converted for use by ModernUO server by Arthrutus.

Note: You may notice that the menu featuring horse barding deed is imperfect. 
In DefBlacksmithy, one may want to change "horse barding deed" to a cliloc number.
An empty cliloc number can be found with UOFiddler. In UOFiddler, simply type 
"horse barding deed" in the empty space next to the cliloc number. This will force
the menu to become perfect!

Please discord me @ Arthrutus#9161 for any questions or if the script no longer works!
